            <h3>
              When we waste food, we also waste all the energy and water it takes to
              grow, harvest, transport, and package it. And if food goes to the
              landfill and rots, it produces methane—a greenhouse gas even more
              potent than carbon dioxide.

            <h3>
              Growing food and getting it to your table takes water, energy, and
              land, including the forests and grasslands that are home to millions
              of species. When food is wasted, all of those other resources are also
              thrown out. In addition, about 10% of all human-caused greenhouse
              gases contributing to climate change are linked to food waste.

              While dairy products, chicken and eggs usually take more resources to
              produce per calorie than staples like wheat or rice, it tends to take
              more energy—and land and water—to produce beef. Corn, especially
              compared to animal products, is a relatively energy efficient crop.

              As per the Food Waste Index Report 2021, a staggering 50 kg of food is
              thrown away per person every year in Indian homes. Greenhouse Gases
              Emission: This excess food waste usually ends up in landfills,
              creating potent greenhouse gases which have dire environmental
              implications.
